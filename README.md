# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes Prediction is a machine learning project developed using python language. K-Nearest Neighbors Model, Decision Tree Model,Naive Bayes Model were used to classify patients whether they have diabetes or not. The following libraries must be installed in order to run the project.
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- preprocessing
- seaborn
- pyexpat
- sklearn
- itertools

# Description of Dataset
Our dataset has 8 descriptive features and 1 target feature in total. Descriptive
features are Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness,Insulin,BMI,
DiabetesPedigreeFunction and Age. Our target feature is Outcome. Each row represents one
person. Pregnancies feature represents number of times pregnant. Glucose feature represents
plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test. BloodPressure
feature represents blood pressure in mmHg. SkinThickness feature represents triceps skin
fold thickness in mm. Insulin feature represents 2 hour serum insulin in mu U/ml. BMI
feature represents body mass index. Body mass index can be calculated by dividing body
mass in kilograms by the square of body length in meters. DiabetesPedigreeFunction feature
represents diabetes pedigree function. Age feature represents age of the person. Outcome
feature represents whether the person has diabetes or not. If the person has diabetes, it is
indicated with 1, otherwise it is indicated with 0.
